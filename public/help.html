<h1>Family Website Help</h1>

<h2>Addressbook</h2>

<p>Entries are not linked to user accounts, but can be any place you wish.</p>
<p>The entry first name is linked to edit the entry itself.</p>
<p>The street address is linked to a Google Map of the location.</p>
<p>The phone numbers are linked with the prefix "tel:" and email with "mailto:"</p>

<h2>Album</h2>

<p>Each active site user will have a block for their uploads.</p>
<p>The first uploaded image will be used for that user's main album entry.</p>
<p>The album can contain any file besides ".txt"</p>
<p>Images (gif/jpg/png) are shown as a linked icon sized version.</p>
<p>If the upload is not an image, currently these formats are recognized with their own icon: .mp3, .mp4 and .pdf</p>
<p>To add a caption for an upload, just type it into the slot below the file and hit the enter key, and it will be saved.</p>

<h2>Calendar</h2>

<p>This rotating calendar is for one-year anniversaries.</p>
<p>The "sticky" flag adds this event as a reminder to the site chat, year-round.</p>
<p>The event notes only appear on the chat during the month or if the sticky flag is applied.</p>

<h2>Chat</h2>

<p>For this demo, the time stamps are all in the Pacific time-zone, but can be anywhere for a particular site.</p>
<p>Angle brackets are not allowed. Please use the <code>& lt ;</code> and <code>& gt ;</code> HTML entities instead (with no spaces).</p>

<h2>Cookbook</h2>

<p>Entries are listed according to their "recipe type", like "Appetizer" for instance.</p>
<p>To add a new recipe, click the "NEW" link in the categories list.</p>
<p>The Ingredients and Instructions input boxes can be resized in most browsers.</p>
<p>When viewing an entry, clicking the title will edit the entry itself.</p>

<h2>Logout</h2>

<p>Please use this when logged-in at a public place.</p>
<p>On your home device, you can stay logged in as long as the browser cookie is present.</p>
<p>In the event that the site has to be restarted or its session files cleared, you will have to re-authenticate.</p>

<h2>Administrator Help</h2>

<p>Visit the <a href="/log">Log page</a> to see a summary of activity and an additional set of admin buttons.</p>
<p>When a new user account is made, an album block and an addressbook entry are made, as well as an optional calendar entry.</p>
<p>There is no email component of signup/grant - the new account process is by personal communication between administrator and new user.</p>
<p>The history page date inputs will accept many common formats, including "yesterday", "today", and "11/26/18."</p>
